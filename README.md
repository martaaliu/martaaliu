### I am a Data Scientist that loves problem solving and challenging myself. Currently, most of my work falls within NLP and Deep Learning.

- 🎓 I have graduated with an MSc Information Studies: Data Science from the University of Amsterdam.

- 🏗️ I have also graduated with an MEng with Honours in Civil Engineering from the University of Nottingham.

- 👩‍🎓 My Data Science Master Thesis dealt with topics such as machine learning, NLP, transformers (BERT, DistilBERT), multi-class text classification, and zero-shot learning. 

- ⚡ Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRucZhapiLc) I made as part of my Data Systems Project course, in which my group developed a dashboard with interactive insights and a recommendation system for museums in the Netherlands using tools such as Python, Tableau, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
